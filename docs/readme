Formatting Guidelines
---------------------------------------------------------
xml UI text: any text visible to the user should be called in the string xml file
           : strings folder in res -> values -> strings.xml
           : strings are defined as <string name="textName">visible text</string>
           : strings are called in xml as android:text="@string/textName"

methods should have 1 line of white space inbetween them
line length should be 100 characters or less
most code called onCreate should be in methods
Methods should try to do 1 thing and be well documented

Documentation Guidelines
---------------------------------------------------------
Every method and class should have proper Documentation having a
description: what the class / method does
pre-condition: preconditions to using this class / method
post-condition: post-conditions to this class, do any variables change?

Commenting Guidelines
---------------------------------------------------------
Comments should be used sparingly
instead break your code into methods with a verb in its name (example: onSignUpButtonClicked)
